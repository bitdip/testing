            Hi there! Welcome to the "One-Prompt Charts" app template. ðŸ“Š
            
            This app allows you to upload your data and get visual insights with just a single prompt. However, to power the magic behind the scenes, I need your OpenAI API key. 
            
            If you don't have a key, you can sign up and create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
            
            Don't worry, your key will be securely stored in the Databutton secrets store, which you can find in the left-side menu under "Configure". If you prefer to add it manually, ensure to assign the name as `OPENAI_API_KEY` for your secret.
            
            Once set up, simply upload your data, prompt about it, and see it visualized! âœ¨
